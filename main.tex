First and foremost, I'd like to thank my supervisor Prof. Dr. Katja Poppenhaeger for her continued support and guidance over the last 3 and a half years. I always appreciated when receiving feedback you would say when you liked something, the positive feedback was refreshing in amongst the things that needed to be changed! I still remember when you asked me at the start of my PhD about my future career plans and were supportive of my potential teaching ambitions. Thank you for taking me on as a PhD student when you first moved to Belfast, I couldn't have asked or wished for a better supervisor.

I also want to thank Dr. Chris Watson for being my secondary supervisor, you are an extremely busy man and I appreciate the time you've given me particularly over the last few months. I want to also thank the wider ARC community for being a welcoming and hard-working department. ARC has been part of my life since 2014 when I started a summer internship here, sparking my interest in doing research full time.

To my fellow ARC PhD students, honestly, I don't know how I would've survived the PhD without the lot of you! I want to thank several in particular; Rick - thanks for all the dog gifs and tales of Rickening events! Peter - thanks for all your support through the medium of sarcasm and evil glares! Tom - thank you for grumbling about X-shooter and allowing me to appreciate my own data more. Steph - thank you for always accepting my stellar astrophysics work and your excellent proof reading skills. Jamie and Rob - thank you for your love of pool and Carling that grew into Friday nights at the pub, without those nights I wouldn't have the friendships I have now and I will always be thankful to you for them.

Finally, I want to say a big thank you to my family for their continued love and support. Grace - thanks for always tempting me to spend my money on Disney holidays! Mum and Dad - thanks for always pushing me to my fullest potential, I wouldn't have had the same opportunities if I hadn't studied Physics to the highest level. I will always look back on my university years with fondness as it has helped me come out of my shell and grow as a person. Who would have thought that the shy girl who cried at her first secondary school away trip to Ganaway would be here completing a PhD in Astrophysics!

\begin{abstract}
\addchaptertocentry{\abstractname} % Add the abstract to the table of contents
Stellar ages are a difficult parameter to calculate as they are not directly observable but must be inferred via other methods. One potential for cool main sequence stars is to determine a relationship between age and magnetic activity. However, the relationship is currently only reliable for ages younger than a gigayear. The work presented in this thesis aims to calibrate the age--activity relationship beyond a gigayear by using ages obtained through asteroseismology, which has become an accurate method of determining ages for cool, main sequence field stars.

The first study uses the X-ray luminosity as a stellar magnetic activity indicator and fourteen stars with detectable X-ray luminosities are used to calibrate the age--activity relationship. A relationship is found between stellar X-ray luminosity (normalised by the stellar surface area) and age that is steeper than the relationships found for younger stars, with an exponent of $-2.80 \pm 0.72$. Given the reports of a flattening relationship between age and rotational period for old cool stars, one possible explanation is that a strong steepening of the relationship between activity and rotation is the cause behind the age--activity trend.

The second study reports on chromospheric Ca~II H and K line measurements for 26 main-sequence cool stars with spectral types F and G by calculating the $R^{'}_{HK}$ indicator that is an alternative magnetic activity indicator. The spectral--type normalised $R^{'}_{HK}$ indicator for the sample is found to be lower than predicted by common age--activity relations. This data suggests that old main-sequence stars follow a steeper decline in activity with age than expected. It is also reported that within the sample there is only a weak trend of $R^{'}_{HK}$ with stellar age, indicating that the Ca~II H and K line emission alone is not a strongly discriminating measurement to determine ages of cool stars beyond a gigayear.

Finally, literature rotation periods for the samples considered in the age--activity relationship were collected. An investigation into the activity--rotation relationship is presented that finds no significant steepening of the relationship. This suggests that alternative mechanisms are at work to cause the steepening of the age--activity relationship. I also present an analysis on the rotation--age relationship and discuss the possible causes for the tension between older and younger stellar populations.
