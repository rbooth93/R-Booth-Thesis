\section{Introduction}
The work presented in this chapter was published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 471, p.1012-1025 as the article entitled "An improved age-activity relationship for cool stars older than a gigayear" \citep{Booth_etal_2017} and modified here to fit within the framework and context of this thesis. This chapter discusses the work conducted in \citet{Booth_etal_2017} in greater depth. \textcolor{red}{Insert here if I have discussed anything that wasn't in the paper}. The aim of this study was to investigate the age-activity relationship beyond a gigayear using X-ray luminosity as a magnetic activity indicator and asteroseismology as the source for stellar ages.

\subsection{Chandra and XMM-Newton telescopes}
This study utilises observations from the \Chandra and \XMM X-ray telescopes which are space-based telescopes in highly eccentric orbits around Earth. This places the telescopes in an ideal position to perform long, uninterrupted observations necessary in the X-ray regime. It is worth mentioning that X-ray telescopes are unlike traditional optical telescopes in their setup. Since X-ray radiation passes through most material, the mirrors must be positioned almost parallel to the incoming photons. This causes the X-ray photons to reflect off the mirror at a grazing incidence, this process is repeated with a secondary mirror in order to focus the X-ray light to a focal point as shown in Figure \ref{fig:diagram_xray_telescope}.

\end{figure}

The \XMM X-ray telescope \citep{Jansen_etal_2001} contains three x-ray CCD cameras collectively known as EPIC. EPIC is made up of one PN detector and two metal oxide detectors (MOS 1 and MOS 2). The MOS detectors are located behind the telescopes grating and only receives approximately half of the incident flux. Whereas the PN detector has an unobstructed beam and a much higher signal to noise than the MOS detectors, therefore data analysis is preferably performed with PN observations. The EPIC instrument is capable of imaging over the telescope's 30 arcmin field of view in the energy range 0.2 - 15 keV (62 - 0.826 \AA). Note that due to the short wavelengths of X-ray radiation, wavelengths are preferably presented in terms of energy. All EPIC CCD's operate in a photon counting mode which produces an event list including the position of photon, arrival time and the photon energy; this allows for both imaging and spectra of X-ray objects.

The \Chandra telescope \citep{Weisskopf_etal_2000} has two focal plane instruments: the advanced CCD imaging spectrometer (ACIS) and the high resolution camera (HRC). The HRC provides only images and no spectral information, therefore in this study observations are restricted to ACIS since it provides spectral information in the energy range 0.2 - 10 keV.

\section{Observations and stellar sample}
\subsection{Sample selection}
\label{Section_sample_selection}
Our target stars with well-determined ages were selected from several different sources. The majority stems from asteroseismology where stars were chosen with precisely determined stellar parameters, including ages, from modelling of individual oscillation frequencies as observed by the Kepler satellite \citep{Silva_Aguirre_etal_2015,Silva_Aguirre_etal_2017}. However, for some stars the signal to noise was not high enough to model the individual oscillation frequencies. In these circumstances, the global asteroseismic parameters \citep{Chaplin_etal_2014} are combined with spectroscopic parameters ($T_{eff}$ and [Fe/H]) and ages are obtained through \texttt{BASTA} \citep{Silva_Aguirre_etal_2015}. \texttt{BASTA} uses a Bayesian approach to determine the probability that a set of parameters matches the observed asteroseismic parameters. Nearby stars were selected for dedicated X-ray observations with \XMM and \Chandra (PI: Poppenhaeger).

The second source is a sample of G and K type stars that are located in wide binaries with a white dwarf companion. As discussed in Section \ref{Section:intro_ages}, the ages of white dwarfs are relatively well known and can act as a stellar chronometer for the binary system. The binaries considered in this study are specifically wide binaries, this is to ensure that any binary companion has not gravitationally interacted with the main sequence star and altered its rotational (and thus magnetic activity) evolution. The sources for these systems are \citet{Garces_etal_2011} and \citet{Zhao_etal_2012}.

While ages have been derived for these systems by \citet{Garces_etal_2011}, more recent work into 3D models of white dwarfs showed that previous fits to 1D models overestimated the effective temperature and surface gravity \citep{Tremblay_etal_2013}. Therefore, a correction was applied to the values calculated in \citet{Garces_etal_2011} by using Equations 7 and 8 from \citet{Tremblay_etal_2013}. With values for the effective temperature and surface gravity, the mass and cooling age of the white dwarfs were calculated using Montreal model grids for white dwarfs with hydrogen atmospheres\footnote{Available at \url{http://www.astro.umontreal.ca/~bergeron/CoolingModels/}} \citep{Holberg_Bergeron_2006,Kowalski_Saumon_2006,Bergeron_etal_2011,Tremblay_etal_2011}. However, to obtain the total age of the white dwarf, the initial-final mass relationship (Equation \ref{Eq:WD_init_final_relationship}) from \citet{Kalirai_etal_2008} was used which allows the mass of the progenitor star to be obtained. Padova stellar evolutionary models \citep{Bertelli_etal_2008} are then used to estimate the main sequence lifetime of the progenitor star which is added to the cooling age of the white dwarf to obtain the total age.

\begin{equation}
    M_{final} = 0.109M_{initial} + 0.394M_{\odot}
    \label{Eq:WD_init_final_relationship}
\end{equation}

The third source includes individually selected stars with archival X-ray observations and relatively well known ages through various methods. these age methods includes asteroseismology (16 Cyg A and B, $\alpha$ Cen / Promixa Cen system), isochrone fitting (61 Cyg A and B) and association with a subpopulation of stars in the galaxy (HR 7703). The Sun is also included in our sample and its age is taken to be $4.57 \pm 0.02$ Gyr \citep{Bahcall_etal_1995}. For the full details on the sample of stars used in this study and the various age methods used see Appendix REF. One may wonder why Proxima Cen is included in our analysis as it is a fully convective star and previous discussion on the age-activity-rotation relationship was focused on stars with a stellar like dynamo (i.e. stars that have radiative core surrounded by a convective envelope). However, recent work by \citet{Wright_Drake_2016} considered a sample of fully convective stars and found that they follow an activity-rotation relationship that is indistinguishable to that of solar-type stars. Since the activity-rotation relationship is a well established proxy for the behaviour of the solar-like dynamo, this results suggest that these fully convective stars exhibit a solar-like dynamo and therefore it was included in the sample.

\subsection{Distances and spectral types}
It is known that the rotational evolution and thus the X-ray luminosity of stars no longer on the main sequence differ than those still on it, therefore only main sequence stars shoud be included in the sample. For several stars from the asteroseismic part of the sample, no luminosity classes were found in the literature. Therefore for these stars, their surface gravity (as calculated from asteroseismology) was compared to the relation of $B-V$ colour and surface gravity as given by \citet{Gray_2005} and shown in Equation \ref{Eq:Gray_2005}. Stars with surface gravities that differed by more than 0.2 dex of the value calculated by Equation \ref{Eq:Gray_2005} were excluded from the sample.

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \log(g) & = 4.25 - 0.3124(B-V) - 0.5022(B-V)^{2} + 6.532(B-V)^{3} \\
    &- 9.9431(B-V)^{4} + 5.7581(B-V)^{5} - 1.1706(B-V)^{6}
    \label{Eq:Gray_2005}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

In order to determine the X-ray luminosity of a star, the distance is required. For the majority of the sample, distances were determined through parallaxes sourced from either SIMBAD \citep{Wenger_etal_2000} or \textit{Gaia} DR1 \citep{Gaia_Collaboration_2016_DR1}. For one star in the asteroseismic part of the sample, no distance or parallax was found in the literature. Therefore, for this star, the Barnes-Evans method was used to calculate the distance. The Barnes-Evans method uses a relation between angular diameter and V-K colour \citep{Fouque_Gieren_1997} shown in Equation \ref{Eq:Fouque_BE_relation} to calculate the angular diameter of a star ($\Theta$ - angular diameter in milli-arcseconds). Since the radius of the star is known through asteroseismology, this can be used with the angular diameter to determine the distance as shown in Equation \ref{Eq:distance_from_angular_diameter} which is derived from trigonometry where $\theta$ is the angular diameter in radians. Since the stars considered in this sample are all located relatively nearby then reddening was not taken into account. The Barnes-Evans method has been used previously to determine the stellar radii of exoplanet host stars and found good agreement with published values \citep{Watson_etal_2010}.

\begin{equation}
    \log\Theta = 0.5474 - 0.2V + 0.262(V-K)
    \label{Eq:Fouque_BE_relation}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    d = \frac{2R_{*}}{\theta}
    \label{Eq:distance_from_angular_diameter}
\end{equation}

Finally, it was necessary to determine the spectral type of the candidates since this influences both the stellar activity and its evolution with time. The stellar spectral types were collected from the SIMBAD \citep{Wenger_etal_2000} database, or estimated from the stellar effective temperatures as published in \citet{Chaplin_etal_2014} and \citet{Silva_Aguirre_etal_2015}.

\section{Data analysis}
This section details the methods used to determine the X-ray luminosity for the sample of stars considered in this work.

Archival data for \XMM were obtained from the XMM-Newton Science Archive and analysed using \texttt{SAS} (Science Analysis system) version $15.0$. The data was filtered to remove any bad pixels or bad events by setting criteria to limit the probability of double photon impact events. This type of event occurs when two photons hit the same or neighbouring pixels in the same readout time frame and causes a slightly different pattern compared to a single photon event. For observations with \XMM, a standard source extraction radius of 20 arcsec is used and a source free background region was chosen with extraction radius of 70 arcsec. Data analysis was also preferably performed with PN observations due to the higher signal to noise from this instrument.

Archival observation files for \Chandra were obtained through the Chandra X-ray Centre public archive and analysed with \texttt{CIAO} (Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observations; \citealt{Fruscione_etal_2006}). For \Chandra data, a standard source extraction radius of 1.5 arcsec was used and a source free background region was chosen with radius of 15 arcsec. For a full list of X-ray observations see Table \ref{table:xray_obs_details}.

\end{table}

\subsection{Source detection}
For each target, the data was tested to see if a source was significantly detected in X-rays using the images from the observations. The number of X-ray counts were extracted from the source and background region from 0.2 - 2.0 keV as this is the region where weakly active cool stars emit most of their X-ray emission.

For \XMM data, there is typically a significant background signal detected in any observation. Therefore, the number of counts expected from a pure background  ($C_{0}$) was estimated by scaling the number of counts detected in the background region to the number expected in an area equivalent to the source region as shown in Equation \ref{Eq:C0_equation} where $C_{b}$ is the number of counts in the background region and $R_{b}$ and $R_{s}$ are the radii of the background and source regions, respectively. The number of counts in the source region ($C_{s}$) is then compared to the $C_{0}$ value and if it exceeds this value by $3\sigma$ then an X-ray source has been detected, otherwise an upper limit is calculated using the $3\sigma$ level over the background signal. Note that $\sigma$ is estimated to be the square root of the number of expected background counts ($C_{0}$). 

\begin{equation}
    C_{0} = \frac{C_{b}}{R_{b}^{2}}R_{s}^{2}
    \label{Eq:C0_equation}
\end{equation}

For \Chandra data, the background signal is typically very low meaning that estimating $\sigma$ as the square root of $C_{0}$ is invalid. Therefore, full Poisson statistics were used and the inverse per cent point function was calculated at which, for a given expected number of background counts (i.e. $C_{0}$), the number of counts in the source region had a probability of less than 0.3 per cent of occurring as a random fluctuation. If the number of source counts was greater than this value then the source was detected; otherwise, that number was used as the upper limit on the X-ray counts for the source. For both \Chandra and \XMM data, the fractional error on $C_{s}$ was taken to be $\frac{\sqrt{C_{s}}}{C_{s}}$.

\subsection{Stellar variability}
The typical exposure time for an X-ray observation is on the order of 10 ks ($\approx$ few hours), however, stars can have variability that occurs on shorter time-scales than this. Therefore, for detected target stars, a light curve was extracted from each observation to check for short-term magnetic phenomena such as flares. This is important as flares release a large amount of energy which causes the corona to heat up thus increasing the temperature and emission measure of the corona (emission measure simply means the amount of material that emits at a particular temperature and is used in spectral fitting - see Section \ref{Section_Determining_Xray_flux}). If flares are detected in our observations, it can result in a significantly higher X-ray luminosity than the quiescent emission level of the star.

    \label{fig:HR7703_lc}
\end{figure}

In the case of Proxima Centauri, the light curve showed several rapid increases in the count rate over the observation exposure time, indicating several flares as shown in Figure \ref{fig:proxima_cen_lc}. Therefore, the quiescent value for the X-ray luminosity of $4.9 \times 10^{26}$ erg $s^{-1}$ was taken from \citet{Fuhrmeister_etal_2011} and used in this work. An inspection of the light curve for HR 7703 indicated that a flare had occurred towards the end of the observation as shown in Figure \ref{fig:HR7703_lc}. In this case, the time interval associated with the flare was excluded from the data analysis.

\subsection{Determining the X-ray flux}
\label{Section_Determining_Xray_flux}
For X-ray sources with significant detections and where the source region contained $\approx 90$ or more counts, the spectra of the source was modelled with a coronal plasma model in order to determine the X-ray flux. A spectrum for the star was extracted from the observations using the relevant analysis tools for each telescope. The extracted spectra were fitted with an optically thin thermal plasma model (APEC model) using the \texttt{XSPEC} fitting software. The APEC model has four parameters: coronal temperature (keV), metal abundances, redshift and emission measure. The emission measure is simply a measure of the amount of material that is emitting at a certain temperature and is defined by Equation REF \textcolor{red}{INSERT EQ AND DEF OF EMISSION MEASURE}. Since all of the stars considered in this sample are located nearby then the redshift was fixed at zero; the abundances were assumed to be solar by using abundances from \citet{Grevesse_Sauval_1998}. Using solar abundances is a reasonable approximation for fairly low-resolution spectra as no significant spectral features are resolved that are highly dependent on metallicity abundances. \textcolor{red}{Check the reason with Katja}
Therefore, the two parameters that were fitted are coronal temperature and emission measure; in some cases, two temperature components were required to find a suitable fit for the coronal spectrum. The \texttt{XSPEC} fitting software uses a modified Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to minimise the fit statistic and is based on \texttt{CURFIT} from \citet{Bevington_1969}. However, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm only finds the local minimum which is not necessary the global minimum, therefore, the initial conditions for each parameter that is to be fitted must be reasonable. From the best-fitting model to each object, the flux was then calculated in a fixed energy band from 0.2 to 2 keV. The details and plots of the best-fitting models are shown in Table \ref{table:spectral_fit_details} and Appendix \ref{Appendix_Xray_spectra}, respectively

\end{table}

In the case where the source region contained $\approx$ 90 counts or less, then typically there were not enough data points to fit a spectrum accurately. Therefore, an estimate of the X-ray flux was obtained through WebPIMMS\footnote{\url{https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/Tools/w3pimms/w3pimms.pl}} using the mean count rate of the source region. A typical spectrum was assumed for the stellar corona, and WebPIMMS calculated the source flux using the instrument characteristics. The X-ray flux was calculated in the $0.2 - 2.0$ keV energy range assuming an APEC model of solar abundance and $\log T$ value of 6.5 ($T \approx 3$ MK), appropriate for inactive cool stars. The conversion factors from counts to flux used for each of the instruments are shown in Table \ref{table:webpimms_conversion_factors}; note that the sensitivity of \Chandra changes significantly over the years of operation, and therefore the correct conversion factors need to be chosen for the observing cycle in which a given observation took place. For \XMM observations, the encircled energy fraction factor needs to be applied as well since its point spread function (PSF) is significantly larger than typical practical source extraction radii. Since a 20 arcsec source radius, this encloses approximately 80\% of the PSF and thus any count rates observed were corrected by dividing by $0.8$.

\end{table}

The statistical error on the values of X-ray counts was calculated from the square root of the number of source counts ($C_{s}$) (as the distribution is described by Poisson statistics) and divided by the number of source counts to obtain a fractional error. This fractional error on the number of counts was also used as the error on the X-ray flux and the X-ray luminosity. However, the X-ray luminosity of a star is known to vary on various time-scales, including time-scales much shorter than the star’s main-sequence lifetime, therefore a minimum physical error of 0.1 dex in $\log L_{x}$ was applied to the data to account for this variability, even if the statistical error was smaller. This value was determined from the long-term X-ray monitoring of 61 Cyg B \citep{Robrade_etal_2012}, a star without an apparent activity cycle, where the standard deviation of the X-ray luminosity was at 0.1 dex over several years of observations. In order to convert X-ray flux into X-ray luminosity, Equation \ref{Eq:flux_luminosity} was used.

\begin{equation}
    L_{x} = 4\pi d^{2}F_{x}
    \label{Eq:flux_luminosity}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Additional notes on analysis}
In the previous section, the general methodology used to determine the X-ray luminosity is detailed. However, since the sample is made up of a number of observations from both the \XMM and \Chandra telescopes, additional details are presented here about the individual observations used and the data reduction.

\textit{16 Cyg A}: This star was detected by combining two \Chandra observations on a front-illuminated CCD, which only provides energy sensitivity above 0.6 keV. The flux was extrapolated for the full $0.2 - 2.0$ keV band by using WebPIMMS and assuming a coronal temperature of $\log T = 6.5$. The star 16 Cyg B was covered by the same observations, but is undetected and an upper limit is calculated. There is also an earlier, shorter \XMM observation covering both stars, but they were npth undetected in that observation, which is consistent with the \Chandra data.

\textit{40 Eri A}: This star is in a wide binary system with the white dwarf 40 Eri B, with a projected distance of 83 arcsec \citep{Wenger_etal_2000}, translating to a physical distance of ca. 400 AU. Using the techniques outlined in Section \ref{Section_sample_selection}, its reported $T_{eff}$ and $\log g$ values \citep{Zhao_etal_2012} to calculate an age of $3.70^{+3.57}_{-1.34}$ Gyr for 40 Eri B, which is adopted as the age of the system. 40 Eri A was observed with a back-illuminated \Chandra CCd, which provides energy sensitivity above 0.245 keV. A spectral fit was performed and the X-ray flux was extrapolated for the full $0.2 - 2.0$ keV energy range. There is also a third star, 40 Eri C, present in the system; however, it is close enough to the white dwarf (ca 35 AU) that its rotation and activity properties may have been affected during the evolution of the white dwarf progenitor, which is why 40 Eri C is not included in the analysis.

\textit{61 Cyg A and B}: these stars have been monitored in X-rays with \XMM over several years. On exemplary X-ray spectrum for each star is shown in Figure \ref{App_A_61Cyg}. 61 Cyg A has been found to display an activity cycle \citep{Robrade_etal_2012}, and the full range of observed X-ray luminosities have been adopted as the error bar for 61 Cyg A's X-ray luminosity found in this work. 61 Cyg B has found to have a flat activity profile \citep{Robrade_etal_2012}, and the mean X-ray luminosity is adopted in this analysis with the standard deviation over all X-ray observations as the error on this value.

\textit{CD-3710500}: This star is in a wide binary system with the white dwarf L481-60. Using the techniques outlined in Section \ref{Section_sample_selection}, its reported $T_{eff}$ and $\log g$ values \citep{Zhao_etal_2012} to calculate an age of $1.77^{+0.65}_{-0.27}$ Gyr for L481-60, which is adopted as the age for the system. The star CD-3710500 was observed with a front-illuminated \Chandra CCD, which provides energy sensitivity above 0.6 keV. A spectral fit was performed and the X-ray flux was extrapolated for the full $0.2 - 2.0$ keV energy range.

\textit{GJ 176}: This star was detected with a back-illuminated \Chandra CCD, which provides energy sensitivity above 0.245 keV. A spectral fit was performed and the X-ray flux was extrapolated for the full $0.2 - 2.0$ keV energy range.

\textit{GJ 191}: This star was detected with a back-illuminated \Chandra CCD, which provides energy sensitivity above 0.245 keV. A spectral fit was performed and the X-ray flux was extrapolated for the full $0.2 - 2.0$ keV energy range. The X-ray luminosity found is consistent with the values reported by \citet{Guinan_etal_2016}.

\textit{HR 7703}: This source was detected with \XMM and a spectral fit was performed for the full energy range of $0.2 - 2.0$ keV.

\textit{KIC 12011630, KIC 3123191 and KIC 5309966}: These stars were in the field of view of \Chandra during observations of other targets and are all undetected in X-rays. The sources are located on front-illuminated CCD's and are far from the centre of the field of view. Since \Chandra's PSF becomes large at the edges of the field of view, large extraction regions had to be used, which led to quite high upper limits for the X-ray luminosities for these stars.

\textit{KIC 10016239 and KIC 7529180}: These stars were detected with \XMM. KIC 7529180 was detected with a sufficient number of source counts so that a spectral fit could be performed. For KIC 10016239, the excess source counts were used to calculate the X-ray flux through WebPIMMS, assuming a coronal temperature of $\log T = 6.5$.

\textit{KIC 6116048, KIC 6603624, KIC 8292840, KIC 9025370, KIC 9410862}: These stars were observed with \XMM, but undetected in X-rays.

\textit{KIC 9955598}: This star was observed and detected with \XMM. Since there is another X-ray source at close projected distance (ca.\ $20$ arcsec), we chose an extraction region with a radius of $10$ arcsec instead of $20$ arcsec, and applied the correct encircled energy fraction factor (0.6) to account for the smaller extraction region when calculating the flux.

\textit{NLTT 7887}: This star is in a wide binary system with the white dwarf NLTT 7890. Since the reported surface gravity of the white dwarf has large errors \citep{Garces_etal_2011}, the age we derive has large errors as well with $4.97^{+8.8}_{-3.0}$~Gyr. The star NLTT 7887 was covered by an \XMM observation, but is undetected.

\textit{$\alpha$ Cen A, $\alpha$ Cen B, Proxima Cen}: The age of this triple system has been derived from asteroseismic observations of $\alpha$ Cen A and $\alpha$ Cen B using different underlying models \citep{Miglio_Montalban_2005}; the mean of the asteroseismic age estimates has been adopted as the age of the system. $\alpha$ Cen A and $\alpha$ Cen B have been monitored in X-rays with \XMM \citep{Robrade_etal_2012}. $\alpha$ Cen B was found to display an activity cycle, and the full range of observed X-ray luminosities is used as the error bar on its X-ray luminosity for our analysis. $\alpha$ Cen A is reported by the same authors to potentially be in an activity cycle as well, however only the low-activity part has been observed so far, and there is no information on what its X-ray luminosity might be during the high-activity part of the cycle. Therefore $\alpha$ Cen A has not been included in this analysis. Proxima Cen has been observed with \XMM several times as well, including multiple stellar flares; a detailed analysis is given by \citet{Fuhrmeister_etal_2011}. Their quiescent X-ray luminosity of $\log L_{\mathrm{X}} = 26.69$ for Proxima Cen has been adopted in this analysis due to the number of flares seen in the observation (see Figure \ref{fig:proxima_cen_lc}).

\section{Results}
\subsection{Magnetic activity across spectral types}
It is known that there is a mass dependence on the rotational spin-down of late-type stars, as many rotational studies include a colour term as a proxy for mass (e.g. \citealt{Barnes_2003,Barnes_2010,Angus_etal_2015}). This is due to the varying depth of the convection zone, F stars have a much thinner convection zone which results in rotational spin-down that occurs on a different timescale than M dwarfs that have a much thicker convection zone \textcolor{red}{(try and expand this point)}. This mass dependence seen in the rotational spin-down will also be present in the evolution of X-ray luminosity with time across varying spectral types. Since the sample of stars considered in this work is relatively small, splitting the sample into different spectral types is non-ideal and an analysis of the whole sample is preferable.

When dealing with X-ray luminosity as a magnetic activity indicator, some studies normalise $L_{x}$ by the stellar bolometric luminosity and then split into different mass bins \citep{Preibisch_Feigelson_2005,Jackson_etal_2012}. However, a different approach was taken by \citet{Schmitt_Liefke_2004}; in their volume complete sample of cool stars in the solar neighbourhood, it was found that when the X-ray luminosity is divided by the stellar surface area $4\pi R_{*}^{2}$ with $R_{*}^{2}$ being the stellar radius, i.e. when one considers the X-ray flux through the stellar surface as a quantity of interest, then stars of all spectral types from F to M show the same spread in this quantity. We visualise these various quantities in Figure \ref{fig:Lx_normalise_schmitt_data}. The stars from \citet{Schmitt_Liefke_2004} were used to plot X-ray luminosity as a function of absolute stellar brightness as a proxy for stellar mass. Preference was given to data collected with the PSPC detector without the Boron filter if several observations were reported in \citet{Schmitt_Liefke_2004}(\textcolor{red}{Explain why}). Using "A Modern Mean Dwarf Stellar Color and Effective Temperature Sequence"\footnote{\url{http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/EEM_dwarf_UBVIJHK_colors_Teff.txt}} \citep{Pecaut_Mamajek_2013}, the reported spectral types \citep{Schmitt_Liefke_2004} were used to find estimates for the effective temperature ($T_{eff}$) and bolometric magnitude ($M_{BOL}$). The bolometric magnitude was then used to calculate the bolometric luminosity using Equation \ref{Eq:bolometric_luminosity} where $L_{BOL\odot}$ is the solar bolometric luminosity ($3.827 \times 10^{33}$ \textcolor{red}{check units of this}) and $M_{BOL\odot}$ is the solar bolometric magnitude ($4.7554$). The stellar radius was calculated using Equation \ref{Eq:stellar_radius} where $k$ is the Boltzmann constant and has a value of $5.6704 \times 10^{-5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ K$^{-4}$. 

\begin{equation}
    L_{BOL} = L_{BOL\odot} 2.5^{M_{BOL\odot} - M_{BOL}}
    \label{Eq:bolometric_luminosity}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    L_{BOL} = 4\pi R_{*}^{2}kT_{eff}^{4}
    \label{Eq:stellar_radius}
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:Lx_normalise_schmitt_data} shows the comparison between X-ray luminosity, X-ray luminosity normalised by stellar surface area and X-ray luminosity normalised by bolometric luminosity. In the left panel of Figure \ref{fig:Lx_normalise_schmitt_data}, the intrinsic mass dependency of X-ray luminosity as a function of mass is clearly seen with higher mass stars typically being more active than lower mass stars. In the right panel of Figure \ref{fig:Lx_normalise_schmitt_data}, the X-ray luminosity normalised by the bolometric luminosity is shown; this shows that lower mass stars typically have higher values on this activity scale, opposite to the trend seen in the X-ray luminosity. This is most likely due to the dependency of bolometric luminosity on both the stellar radius and effective temperature (see Equation \ref{Eq:stellar_radius}), where the extreme differences in effective temperatures from F to M dwarfs cause the trend shown here. Whereas if the X-ray luminosity through the stellar surface area is considered (as shown in the middle panel of Figure \ref{fig:Lx_normalise_schmitt_data}), a flat distribution is seen as a function of absolute magnitude (the proxy for mass in this plot) as reported by \citet{Schmitt_Liefke_2004}.

    \caption[Comparison of X-ray luminosity and normalised parameters]{Comparison of data taken from \citet{Schmitt_Liefke_2004} when normalised by bolometric luminosity and stellar surface. \textbf{Left Panel}: Logarithmic value of X-ray luminosity as a function of absolute magnitude in V band. \textbf{Middle Panel}: Logarithmic value of X-ray luminosity normalised by the stellar surface area as a function of absolute magnitude in V band. \textbf{Right Panel}: Logarithmic value of the ratio of X-ray luminosity to bolometric luminosity as a function of absolute magnitude in V band.}
    \label{fig:Lx_normalise_schmitt_data}
\end{figure}

Therefore, the X-ray luminosities of the sample of cool, inactive stars considered in this work were normalised by the stellar surface area as this allowed for a combined analysis of the full sample to be performed. The stellar radii for the stars in the sample were taken either from asteroseismology or calculated using the same technique described previously for the \citet{Schmitt_Liefke_2004} sample using absolute brightness and effective temperature.
